# Flask-Structure - Base Structure for API Projects üß±
[![Licen√ßa](https://img.shields.io/badge/Licen√ßa-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/piedro404/flask-structure/blob/main/LICENSE.md)

A Python library dedicated to exemplify and facilitate the start of Flask projects for APIs üí´. Download flask-structure and streamline the "start" of your projects with ease üöÄ.

##### Organized and Scalable Structure. üòéüì±

### Structure

#### Details
- Controllers: Contains controllers that manage the application logic, connecting routes to specific operations.
- Drivers: Stores the drivers and libraries necessary to connect and operate with other services or hardware.
- Errors: Defines specific error types and custom exceptions that can be triggered during code execution.
- Main: The main entry point of the application. Within this folder, "Routes" manages API routes, and "Server" is responsible for starting and managing the web server.
- Models: Contains data models, usually classes representing tables in the database.
- Static: Stores static files such as CSS, JS, images, etc., needed to render front-end web pages.
- Templates: Maintains HTML templates and documentation related to the structure or usage of the API.
- Validators: Includes scripts or modules to validate input data or API requests.
- Views: Defines different types of HTTP responses and views associated with presentation logic.

# API Structure Features üî®
- Info: Welcomes users and provides relevant information about the API and contacts.
- Docs: A place to learn about the API and how to use it interactively and dynamically.
- Favicon.ico: Icon to be displayed in the website window.

# Key Technologies Used üåê
- Flask: Framework used for web application development, providing a flexible and efficient structure for creating APIs and user interfaces.
- Python: Primary programming language chosen for its versatility, simplicity, and large developer community.
- Cerberus: Python data validation library, used to ensure the integrity and consistency of data manipulated by the application.
- Other Libraries: The rest of the libraries can be found in requirements.txt, including various tools and utilities that complement and enhance the application's functionality.

# Documentation üìÉ

### API:
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and definitions that allows communication between different software. It enables applications and services to exchange information and functionality efficiently and standardized.

### Key Uses in Development:
1. Service Integration:
   APIs facilitate integration between different services and platforms, allowing applications to share data and functionality.
2. Mobile Application Development:
   APIs are essential for mobile app development, providing access to resources such as location, camera, notifications, among others.
3. Access to External Data:
   Used to obtain data from external sources, such as social networks, databases, third-party services, providing up-to-date information.
4. Integration with Web Platforms:
   APIs are crucial for integrating web applications, enabling efficient communication between the front-end and back-end.
5. Microservices Development:
   In microservices architectures, APIs are essential for communication between the various distributed components of an application.
6. Task Automation:
   APIs allow the automation of routine tasks, optimizing processes and improving operational efficiency.
7. Plugin and Extension Development:
   Used to create plugins and extensions in various platforms, expanding the functionalities of existing software.
8. Resource Economy:
   Facilitate development by allowing the reuse of already implemented functionalities, saving time and resources.

# How to Run the Library Locally üõ†Ô∏è
1. Virtual Environment (Optional)
For organization and ease of running the project, I suggest creating a virtual environment. To do this, use the following command:
```Bash
  python -m venv .venv
```
```Bash
  .venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Download the library:
```bash
   pip install flask-structure
```

3. Run the command to create the project structure
```Bash
  flask-structure create
```

4. Install dependencies:
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
   
5. Run the application:
```bash
   python run.py
```

6. Use the structure your way ;)
